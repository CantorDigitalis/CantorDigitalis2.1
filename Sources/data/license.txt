This software is a singing synthesis computer program made of a digital formant synthesizer driven by one or several control interfaces. It is composed of a suite of Max patches.

CantorDigitalis is a performative parametric voice synthesizer. It implements the linear acoustic source-filter model of voice production. The "filter" or "vocal tract" part of the system is computed using a parallel structure made of digital second-order resonators. Vowels are controlled according to synthesis rules. The "source" or "glottal flow derivative" part of the system is computed using a linear model. The source parameters are combined for controlling six vocal dimensions: pitch, voice tension, laryngeal mechanism, breathiness, roughness, and vocal effort. CantorDigitalis includes presets for voice categories (baritone, tenor, alto, soprano), voice range profiles, source-filter dependencies (formant and harmonic tuning), vocal tract size, vocalic space and voice quality control.

[s2m.wacom] is based on the design of the [wacom] object whose history is :
  - Version 3. (for OSX) by Jean-Michel Couturier, CNRS-LMA, France, 2003.
  - wacom object for os9 (version 2) by Richard Dudas. Copyright (c) 1999, the Regents of the University of California.
    Special thanks to Atau Tanaka for suggesting this object back in the Bionic days. Thanks to CNMAT for sponsoring the version 2.
